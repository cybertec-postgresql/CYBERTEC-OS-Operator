      <description>Backups are essential for databases. From broken storage to deployments gone wrong, backups often save the day. Starting with pg_dump, which was released in the late 1990s, to the archiving of WAL files (PostgreSQL 8.0 / 2005) and pg_basebackup (PostgreSQL 9.0 / 2010), PostgreSQL already offers built-in options for backups and restores based on logical and physical backups.&#xA;Backups with pgBackRest CPO relies on pgBackRest as its backup solution, a tried-and-tested tool with extensive backup and restore options.</description>

      <description>This chapter describes the use of pgBackRest in combination with Google Cloud Storage (gcs). It is not absolutely necessary to operate a Kubernetes on the Google Cloud Platform. However, as with any cloud storage, the efficiency and therefore the duration of a backup depends on the connection.&#xA;Precondition: a gcs-bucket and a priviledged role is needed for this chapter. Create a gcs-bucket on the google cloud console Create a priviledged service-role Modifying the Cluster Backups on PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) When using block storage, the operator creates an additional pod that acts as a repo host.</description>
